Hi! My name is Marcos, a 21 year old Cybersecurity student. On the Internet, I'm better known as S3n or S3ntinl. Currently, I'm studying a Master's Degree on Cybersecurity in Information Technology Environments, while preparing for **OSCP** Certification. I spend pretty much all my time coding, doing CTFs or studying, so this blog is a way of tracking my progress and sharing it with others as a way of improving the hacking community!
